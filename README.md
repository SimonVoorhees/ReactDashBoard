A project I made using a wireframe given to me by my mentors. The goal was to style it to match the wireframe using mobile first development. I had 3 breakpoints: mobile, tablet, and desktop. I used very basic images, random data, and Lorem Ipsum. I did manage to get some of the functionality working like the to do list, but the point of this project was the styling not the functionality. 

A very basic project using create react app. I recently (9/7/23) went through some of the css and restyled it to make it look a bit cleaner.

I found node version 9.10.0 to be best for running this project locally. You can see it online at https://sxv2721.github.io/ReactDashBoard/ though it has not yet been updated with the latest styling fixes.
